                <h2>Short Version</h2>

                <p>If the universe was made naturally, and the laws of physics are random, we would expect it to meet the bare minimum requirments for containing consciousness. Instead, we live in a universe that goes <em>much</em> further than that. Advanced Technology <em>and</em> organic life are both allowed in our universe instead of just consciousness. If getting either one is like winning the lottery, then getting both is like winning it twice. Alternatively, God designed the universe to allow for both conscious life <em>and</em> advanced technology.</p>

                <h2>Long Version</h2>

                <p>The Multiverse Theory is the idea that there are multiple, perhaps infinite, universes that exist simultaneously, each with its own unique set of physical laws and constants. Live Science explains the theory as follows: "[E]ach universe would emerge with its own laws of physics, its own collection of particles, its own arrangement of forces and its own values of fundamental constants."<sup><a href="#source-1" id="return-1">1</a></sup></p>

                <p>If the multiverse theory is true, the vast majority of universes would be lifeless wastelands. We would also expect the <em>very</em> vast majority of universes that <em>do</em> permit life would be <em>just</em> complicated enough to allow for consciousness to arise, and not much more since its so hard for a universe to pull off allowing life at all.</p>

                <p>However, our universe is not simple the way the vast majority of life-sustaining universes should be. If our universe allows for complex systems like robots and other advanced technologies to work in addition to conscious organisms, then the universe is <em>far</em> more complex than it needs to be. If our universe successfully functions more than necessary, then it being formed this way is astronomically improbable. Like I said earlier, it would be like winning the lottery with both of your tickets.</p>

                <h2>Objections</h2>
            
                <p><b>Objection:</b> "There's overlap between the physics for organic life and advanced technology"</p>

                <p><b>Response:</b> That doesn't help much. The laws of physics that allow for both types of complex structures are <em>very</em> minimal. It is astronomically more likely to have the capability for one or the other, but not both. think about how different these structures are from one another. There are so many differences between the two that go <em>far</em> beyond the laws of physics that keep them functioning. These two structures have next to nothing in common.</p>
