                <h1><a href="r_science.html">The Bible Calls the Moon a Light.</a></h1>

                <h2>Claim</h2>

                <p>The Bible refers to the moon as a light. However, it only reflects light, it doesn't produce it.</p>

                <h2>Passage</h2>

                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201&version=NRSVCE#:~:text=16%C2%A0God%20made%20the%20two%20great%20lights%E2%80%94the%20greater%20light%20to%20rule%20the%20day%20and%20the%20lesser%20light%20to%20rule%20the%20night%E2%80%94and%20the%20stars.">Genesis 1:16</a></p>

                <h2>Short Response</h2>

                    <p>Being refered to as "A light" doesn't mean it produces that light.</p>

                <h2>Long Response</h2>

                    <p>The mistake made here is the idea that for the moon to be a “light” it must create the light. This is not true, however. Here’s an analogy: say you have two friends. Your first friend gives your second friend $5. Then your first and second friends each give you $5. Did you receive money from both of your friends, or exclusively from your first friend? Obviously, you received money from both friends. Likewise, if the moon is reflecting light that came from the sun, you still have two lights.</p>

                    <p>It is also worth noting that people used to worship the sun, moon, and stars.<sup><a href="#source-1">1</a></sup> To call them “lights” and to state what they can be used for was likely meant to remind the ancient audience that they should not treat them as idols, but rather use them for beneficial purposes. God actually states the uses of these “lights” in verse 14.</p>
