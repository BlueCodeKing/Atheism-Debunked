                <h2>Claim</h2>

                <p>During Jesus' 40 day fast, Satan brought him to a mountain top to show him all the kingdoms of the earth. However, you would need the earth to be flat to look directly at things so far away.</p>

                <h2>Passages</h2>

                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%204%3A8-10&version=NRSVCE#:~:text=8%C2%A0Again,serve%20only%20him.%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D">Matthew 4:8-10</a></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%204%3A5-8&version=NRSVCE#:~:text=5%C2%A0Then,serve%20only%20him.%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D">Luke 4:5-8</a></p>

                <h2>Short Response</h2>

                    <p>Satan was showing Jesus the kingdoms in a vision.</p>

                    <h2>Long Response</h2>

                    <p>Jesus wasn't standing on a mountain so he could see better. He was lead to the mountain top by Satan because Satan was going to tempt Jesus to worship him in exchange for all the kingdoms of the world. The reason for doing this on a mountain top is because in the Bible, false idols are worshipped on "high places" (Jeremiah 7:31, 19:5; Hosea 4:13). It wasn't so he could get a better view.</p>

                    <p>As for seeing all the kingdoms, Luke says that Satan showed him all the World's kingdoms <b>in a moment in time.</b> The Greek word for "moment" is στιγμῇ (stigmē). <sup><a href="#source-1">1</a></sup> This is better translated as "for an instant", or "dot" implying a <em>very</em> brief duration.<sup><a href="#source-2">2</a></sup> Rather than being Jesus observing each kingdom from one direction to the next. Even if we ignored that, this obviously isn't trying to get us to think that Jesus could see all the kingdoms of the earth from a mountain top. The kingdoms wouldn't be visible on a flat earth. They would look too small to be seen!</p>
