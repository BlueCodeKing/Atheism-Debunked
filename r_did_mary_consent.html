                <h1><a href="r_morality.html">Mary Didn't Consent to Being Pregnant with Jesus</a></h1>

                <h2>Claim</h2>

                <p>God never got Mary's consent to make her pregnant.</p>

                <h2>Passage</h2>

                <p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201%3A31&version=NRSVCE#:~:text=31%C2%A0And%20now%2C%20you%20will%20conceive%20in%20your%20womb%20and%20bear%20a%20son%2C%20and%20you%20will%20name%20him%20Jesus.">Luke 1:31</a></p>


                <h2>Short Response</h2>

                    <p>Actualy she did.</p>

                <h2>Long Response</h2>

                    <p>Mary explicitly consents to being pregnant with Jesus in Luke 1:38.</p>

                    <p>[Luke 1:38] "Then Mary said, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her."</p>

                <h2>Objections</h2>

                <p><b>Objection:</b> "Mary only consented <em>after</em> the angel Gabriel told her what would happen."</p>

                <p><b>Response:</b> If God is all-knowing, He would know if Mary wanted a baby or not ahead of time. Judging from the quoted passage, it seems she did. Just like most women of her time.</p>
